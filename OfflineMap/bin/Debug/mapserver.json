Street-level data includes the United States; much of Canada; Japan; Europe; Australia and New Zealand; India; South America and Central America; most of the Middle East; Egypt and Morocco; and parts of southern Africa including Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. This comprehensive street map includes highways, major roads, minor roads, one-way arrow indicators, railways, water features, administrative boundaries, cities, parks, and landmarks, overlaid on shaded relief imagery for added context. The map also includes building footprints for selected areas. Coverage is provided down to ~1:4k with ~1:1k and ~1:2k data available in select urban areas. The street map was developed by Esri using Esri basemap data, DeLorme basemap layers, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) elevation data, Intact Forest Landscape (IFL) data for the world; HERE data for Europe, Australia and New Zealand, India, North America, South America and Central America, most of the Middle East and parts of southern Africa (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland).
